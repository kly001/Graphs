"""

Write a function that takes a 2D binary array and returns the number of 1 islands. An island consists of 1s that are connected to the north, south, east or west. For example:
islands = [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
           [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]
island_counter(islands) # returns 4

1. Describe in graph terms:
    What are the nodes? ==> all the 1's
    When do we have a edge to another node? ==> If it is one step away in any direction (NSEW)

What do we call a group of nodes? => Connected components

2. Build your graph or define getNeighbors()


3. Choose your algorithm
